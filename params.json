{"name":"Betatree","tagline":"Generate and analyze beta coalescent trees","body":"![Site Frequency Spectra](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rneher/betatree/master/example_SFS/sfs_logit_binning.png)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nbetatree is a collection of python scripts to generate trees from the beta coalescent ensemble, calculate properties of those trees and gather statistics across many instances. \r\n\r\nAuthors: Taylor Kessinger and Richard Neher\r\n\r\nContact: richard.neher@tuebingen.mpg.de\r\n\r\nExample output of the betatree generator are given as pdf files in example_trees. Example site frequency spectra for different parameters of the beta-coalescent ensemble are provided in example_SFS.\r\n\r\n### Tree generation\r\n\r\nthe script src/betatree.py provides a class that generates coalescent trees using pseudorandom numbers given an initial sample size n and a parameter alpha of the beta measure of the Lambda coalescent process. The following 3 lines will generate a tree of a sample size of 100 and draw it with the Biopython.Phylo package.\r\n\r\n    myT = betatree(100,alpha = 2)\r\n    myT.coalesce()\r\n    Phylo.draw(myT.BioTree)\r\n\r\nthe tree is internally stored as a biopython.phylo tree with all the associated  functionality.\r\n\r\nSample code is appended to the definition of the class as will be exectuted if betatree.py is run as main.\r\n\r\n### Site frequency spectra\r\n\r\nthe script src/sfs.py uses the class betatree to generate many trees and calculate the SFS assuming that mutation are uniformly distributed on the tree. The following three lines will generate an SFS for a sample size 100 and alpha=1.5 by averaging 1000 trees.\r\n\r\n    mySFS = SFS(n=100,alpha=1.5)\r\n    mySFS.getSFS(ntrees=1000)\r\n\r\nThe sfs is accessible as mySFS.sfs and can be binned using different binning schemes or a user defined binning. \r\n\r\n    mySFS.binSFS(mode='logit', bins=20)\r\n    plt.plot(mySFS.bin_center, mySFS.binned_sfs)\r\n\r\nThe sfs can be saved and loaded by member functions.\r\n\r\nSample code is appended to the definition of the class as will be exectuted if sfs.py is run as main.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Dependencies:\r\n\r\npython 2.7\r\nnumpy\r\nscipy\r\nbiopython\r\nmatplotlib for plotting examples","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
